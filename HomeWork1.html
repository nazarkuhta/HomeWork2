<h1>Robert Downey Jr.</h1>
<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr.">Robert John Downey Jr.</a> (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor and producer. His career has been characterized
    by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, before a
    resurgence of commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine among the 100 most
    influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid
    actor.

<h2>Films
</h2>
<p>Downey gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark / Iron Man in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic
    Universe, beginning with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(2008_film)">Iron Man</a> (2008).

    <li>Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by
        Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[N 1] it is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
        (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art
        Marcum and Matt Holloway, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence Howard,
        Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, and Gwyneth Paltrow. In the film, following his escape from captivity by a terrorist
        group, world famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a mechanized suit of armor and becomes
        the superhero Iron Man.

    A film featuring the character was in development at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at
    various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as
    its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and
    faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming
    took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero
    stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own
    dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by
    Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character.

    Iron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in
    Phase One of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million, becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of 2008. The film received
    praise from critics, especially for Downey's performance. It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the
    ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the 81st Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual
    Effects. Two sequels have been released: Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013).
